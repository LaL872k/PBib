# PBib

PBib is a project designed to make citing work easier. What makes this project different than [EasyBib][1] is that it adds citations to word documents after the citations are formatted. The formatting for the citations is designed after [this document][2].

<h3>How to Use the Application</h3>

In order to add a bibliography or footnotes using this application, you must have selected a file, and added citaitons. To select a file click on the button that says "Select File" when the application opens, from there you can navigate to the file of your choice that ends in  either .doc or .docx. To add citations click on the "Add Citations" button, this will bring up another window that lets you navigate the different types of sources at the top. Once you have filled out the form for the citation click "Add Citation". After these two tasks have been completed you can both add footnotes and a bibliography to the document you selected.

To add footnotes you must place the your caret in at the position where the footnotes reference should be loacted inside the text box, and select a citation to the left. After that you may click "Add Footnote", this will add a footnote at the location of yout caret inside the text box. Click "Add Footnotes" to finish the process and add all of the selected footnotes.

Before the bibliography is added it brings up a screen that lets you select which citations should be included in the bibliography. Keep the citations that you wish to be added and click "Add Bibliography".
